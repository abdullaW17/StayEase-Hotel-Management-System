## 🗄️ Database Schema

The database (`stayease_db`) contains **7 interrelated tables**:

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `RoomType` | Lookup table for room categories (Standard, Deluxe, Suite, etc.) with pricing |
| `Room` | Physical hotel rooms (101–501) with real-time status |
| `Staff` | Hotel employees with roles: **Manager**, **Receptionist**, **Housekeeping** |
| `Guest` | Guest profiles identified by CNIC/Passport |
| `Reservation` | Bookings linking guests to rooms with check-in/out dates |
| `Service` | Extra charges per reservation (laundry, food, airport pickup, etc.) |
| `Payment` | Payment records per reservation (supports split payments) |

### Room Statuses
`Available` · `Occupied` · `Cleaning` · `Maintenance`

### Reservation Statuses
`Pending` · `Confirmed` · `Occupied` · `CheckedOut` · `Cancelled`

### Room Types & Pricing (Seed Data)
| Type | Capacity | Price/Night (Rs.) |
|---|---|---|
| Standard Single | 1 | 5,000 |
| Economy Twin | 2 | 6,000 |
| Deluxe Double | 2 | 8,500 |
| Executive Suite | 4 | 15,000 |
| Presidential Suite | 6 | 45,000 |

**Port:** `5000`

### API Endpoints

| Module | Base Route | Key Operations |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | `/api/auth` | `POST /login` – Staff login by ID & password |
| Dashboard | `/api/dashboard` | `GET /` – Summary stats (occupancy, revenue, etc.) |
| Guests | `/api/guests` | Full CRUD – list, add, update, delete guests |
| Reservations | `/api/reservations` | Full CRUD – create, update status, checkout flow |
| Rooms | `/api/rooms` | `GET /` – Room list; `PATCH /:id/status` – Update status |
| Services | `/api/services` | Add & list extra services per reservation |
| Payments | `/api/payments` | Record payments per reservation |
| Reports | `/api/reports` | Revenue, room stats, monthly bookings, operational report |
| Staff | `/api/staff` | View and manage staff members |

### Reports Available
- **Revenue Report** – Total room revenue + service charges
- **Room Statistics** – Booking count by room type
- **Monthly Bookings** – Booking trends by month
- **Operational Report** – Live room-by-room status with financials (bill vs. paid, balance due)

| `Dashboard` | Key metrics: rooms available, active guests, revenue |
| `GuestList` | Search, view, edit, delete guests |
| `GuestForm` | Add or edit guest profile (CNIC validation) |
| `ReservationList` | View all reservations, filter by status, confirm/cancel |
| `ReservationForm` | Create new reservation with room & guest selection |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) 8.0+

### 1. Set Up the Database

Open MySQL and run the SQL scripts in order:

```sql
SOURCE path/to/01_schema.sql;
SOURCE path/to/02_seed.sql;
```

This creates the `stayease_db` database with all tables and populates it with **15 sample records** per table.

### 2. Configure the Backend

The database connection is hardcoded in `stayease_backend/db.js`. Update credentials if needed:

```js
// stayease_backend/db.js
const pool = mysql.createPool({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'root',
    password: 'dbpassword123',   // ← Change to your MySQL password
    database: 'stayease_db',
});
```

### 3. Start the Backend

```bash
cd 23i2060-23i2064-23i2045_ProjectFolder/stayease_backend
npm install
node app.js
# Server runs at http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd 23i2060-23i2064-23i2045_ProjectFolder/stayease-frontend
npm install
npm start
# App opens at http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Login

Use any staff record from the seed data. Default password for all staff: `user123`

| Staff ID | Name | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ahsan Khan | Manager |
| 3 | Sarah Ahmed | Receptionist |
| 8 | Zainab Bibi | Housekeeping |

## 🧩 Key Design Decisions

- **RBAC via Role field** – No JWT used; role returned from login is stored in React Context and used for conditional UI rendering.
- **Cascade Deletes** – Deleting a Guest cascades to their Reservations → Services & Payments, keeping the DB consistent.
- **Split Payments** – The `Payment` table has no `UNIQUE` constraint on `reservation_id`, allowing multiple payment installments.
- **Operational Report** – Calculates real-time balance due per room by comparing accumulated room + service costs against payments recorded.
